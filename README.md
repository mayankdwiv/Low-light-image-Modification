Input image Input displays the prompt string on the 
screen, waits for input from the keyboard, evaluates any expressions in the input, and returns the result. To 
evaluate expressions, the input function can use 
variables in the current workspace


Illumination map 
Global illumination, or indirect illumination, is a 
general name for a group of algorithms used in 3D 
computer graphics that are meant to add more realistic 
lighting to 3D scenes. Such algorithms take into 
account not only the light that comes directly from a 
light source (direct illumination), but also subsequent 
cases in which light rays from the same source are 
reflected by other surfaces in the scene, whether 
reflective or not (indirect illumination). 

Gamma correction 
Gamma correction can roboticallyenhance the image 
contrast. Gamma correction is a non-linear operation, 
which is used to correcting lightness or darkness of 
image. According to the gamma value only image 
brightness can be corrected. Gamma value ranging 
from 0 to 1. If gamma value less then 1- Image gets 
lighten. Else gamma value equal to 1, no changes in an 
image. Gamma is apply only for display image not to 
the data of image. Within gamma correction three 
major process are done. First Histogram analysis, 
which provides the spatial information of an input 
image. In the second step, the weighting distribution is 
used to even the irregular occurrence and thus avoid 
generation of inauspicious artifacts. In the third and 
final step, gamma correction can robotically enhance 
theimage.

Block Matching 3d Method 
The enhancement of the sparsely is achieved by 
grouping similar 2D fragments of the image into 3D 
data arrays which we call groups. Collaborative ltering 
is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3D 
groups. It includes three successive steps: 3D 
transformation of a group, shrinkage of transform 
spectrum, and inverse 3D transformation. Thus, we 
obtain the 3D estimate of the group which consists of 
an array of jointly itered 2D fragments. Due to the 
similarity between the grouped blocks, the transform 
can achieve a highly sparse representation of the true 
signal so that the noise can be well separated by 
shrinkage. In this way, the collaborative ltering reveals 
even the nest details shared by grouped fragments and 
at 
the 
same time it preserves the essential 
uniquefeatures ofeach individual fragment.
